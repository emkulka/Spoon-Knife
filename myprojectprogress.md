Possible Projects

I'm interested in a variety of projects. I like projects that improve efficiency (ex: [Gerrit Code Review](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) allows for code reviews to take place within a Git repo). I also enjoy projects that have a positive social impact/improve people's lives in some way (even minorly). I'm not quite sure how I would want to organze a project like this at this time, but I would be interested in using a blessed repository so that I can gain experience working with this style of repo.
